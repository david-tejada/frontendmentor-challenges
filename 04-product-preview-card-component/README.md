## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- BEM: Not everything has to be an element. E.g. button
- Firefox responsive mode (without having to have the devtools open): cmd-alt-m (macOS).
- Use `.visually-hidden` or `.sr-only` to display information for screen reader users. For example, the previous price in this page.
- Vertical spacing using `display: grid` and `gap`.
